```
Write an algorithm that processes the output of Algorithm 1 in order to find the neighboring faces of any face. 
That is, faces that share an edge with the query face. 
It should take the output of Algorithm 1 as input, unique identifier for the face and output an array of face identifiers. 
The face identifiers might be an integer or string. Include tests (with text descriptions of the input data) demonstrating that it works. 
Comment your code with specifics about the computational complexity of your implementation.
```;
function getNeighboringFaces() {
  // 1. if we output the list of edges, then trivially scan the list for overlapping indices
}
