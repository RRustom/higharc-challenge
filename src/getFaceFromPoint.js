```
Given a point and the output of Algorithm 1, find the face the point is contained within. 
Naturally, the point may not be inside of a face. 
Include tests (with text descriptions of the input data) demonstrating that it works. 
Comment your code with specifics about the computational complexity of your implementation.

Input: output of Alg1, coordinates of a point
Output: index of face in output of Alg1
```;
function getFaceFromPoint() {}
