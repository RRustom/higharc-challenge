```
Implement an algorithm that, given a start face, computes the neighboring faces, and then the neighbors of the neighbor faces and so on. 
The system should find “layers” of neighboring face sets. The output should be an array of arrays of face ids until
all faces have been visited. 
Include tests (with text descriptions of the input data) demonstrating that it works.
```;
function getFaceLayers() {}
